<h1><b>Tips for Playing Mafia</b></h1>

<!-- Must Know Tips Section -->
<h2>Must Know Tips</h2>
<img src="media/tips.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" align="right">
<p>To succeed in Mafia, whether you’re a Citizen or playing a special role, blending in is critical. If you're Mafia or the Killer, act like a Citizen to avoid drawing attention. Observe how others talk and behave—changes in speech or body language can reveal hidden roles. If accused, stay calm and present a logical defense. Mafia members should quietly spread doubt and steer votes away from their teammates. Detectives should share their findings carefully, not too early to avoid being exposed. Medics should protect likely targets but switch it up to keep enemies guessing</p>
